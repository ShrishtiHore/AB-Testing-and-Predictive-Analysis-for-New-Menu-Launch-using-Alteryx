# AB-Testing-and-Predictive-Analysis-for-New-Menu-Launch-using-Alteryx

The coffee restaurant would like to conduct a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu.
To minimize the risk, the management team decides to test the changes in two cities with new television advertising. Denver and Chicago were chosen to participate in this test because the stores in these two cities perform similarly to all stores across the entire chain of stores; performance in these two markets would be a good proxy to predict how well the updated menu performs.
The predicted impact to profitability should be enough to justify the increased marketing budget: at least 18% increase in profit growth compared to the comparative period while compared to the control stores; otherwise known as incremental lift.

###Performance Metric for evaluating the result of A/B test: **Gross margin**

###Test Period: **4/29/2016 â€“ 7/21/2016 (12 weeks)**

###Agrregation Level: **Weekly**
